Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software Engineering systematically applies engineering principles, methods, and tools to develop and maintain high-quality software systems. It's important as it enables the creation of software applications  and systems that power various aspects of human life.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. Development of programming languages e.g. C and Fortran. C led to creation of Windows Operating Systems.
2. Agile Methodologies -  These allow collaboration and response to change.
3. Advent of structured programming  

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Requirements: Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
2. Design: Creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
3. Implementation: Writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
4. Testing: Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
5. Deployment: Releasing the software to users or customers.
6. Maintenance: Providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after deployment.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
1. Waterfall: Sequential approach with distinct phases......it is best used where all the requirements are predefined.
2. Agile: Iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration, and change response......It is best used where all the requirements are unknown or where they keep on changing.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
1. Software Developer: Responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions.
2. Quality Assurance Engineer: Ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
3. Project Manager: Oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
1. IDEs enable writing, debugging, and testing of code. e.g. IntelliJ IDEA.
2. VCS - enable tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members e.g. Git

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
1. Changing Requirements - software engineers should be open, adaptable, and open to change.
2. Tight Deadlines - can be solved by proper time and schedule management. Prioritization of tasks
3. Technical Debt

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
1. Unit Testing: Testing individual components or modules of software.
2. Integration Testing: Testing interactions between different components or subsystems.
3. System Testing: Testing the entire software system as a whole.
4. Acceptance Testing: Testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.
Importance:  They help identify and fix defects early in the development process, leading to higher-quality software products.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is all about crafting questions or statements to get the best possible responses from AI models. 


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague - "Ram"
Improved - "What is ram and why is it important in computers?"
The improved is more specific to what you are asking  and clearer to the AI for it to generate a better response
